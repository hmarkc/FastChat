Satellite mass: If the satellite's mass changes during its orbit, the gravitational force acting on it will change as well. This could lead to changes in the satellite's orbital characteristics, such as its period of revolution. To handle this, we would need to consider the updated mass of the satellite and recalculate the gravitational force acting on it.\n\n2.

Probability is a way to measure the likelihood of an event occurring. It is often represented as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event will not happen, and 1 means the event will definitely happen. For example, if you toss a fair coin, the probability of getting heads is 0.5 because there are two equally likely outcomes - heads or tails.\n\nAlien: Thank you for the explanation. Can you provide more examples of probability in everyday life?\n\nHuman: Of course! Let's say you are playing a game of chance where you have to roll a dice. The probability of rolling a specific number, such as a 3, is 1/6 because there are six equally likely outcomes (numbers 1 to 6) and only one of them is a 3. Another example is flipping a coin. The probability of getting heads is 1/2 because there are two equally likely outcomes - heads or tails.\n\nAlien: I understand the concept of probability now.

Increased orbital radius: The increased distance between the Earth and the satellite means that the force of gravity between them is weaker.

However, since the distance between the Earth and the satellite has increased, the total force of gravity remains constant, so the satellite's orbital radius increases.\n2.

Here are some examples:\n\n1. Residual forces: When a satellite is in a circular orbit, there are always residual forces acting on it, such as atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure. These forces can cause the satellite to lose altitude and change its orbit. To handle this, we need to take into account the effects of these forces when modeling the satellite's behavior.\n2. Non-uniform rotation of the Earth: The Earth's rotation is not uniform, and this can cause issues when modeling the Earth's gravitational force on a satellite. To account for this, we need to use a more accurate model of the Earth's shape and rotation, which can be obtained from geodetic models.\n3.

In other words, it's the mistake of assuming that the probability of an event is the same for all members of a group, rather than the number of instances of that event in the group.\n\nHere are five examples of how politicians use the base rate fallacy in their campaigns:\n\n1. \"We'll create jobs for everyone!\" - This statement is an example of the base rate fallacy because it assumes that everyone will have a job, without considering the number of jobs available in the economy.\n2. \"We'll reduce crime by 50%!\" - This statement is also an example of the base rate fallacy because it assumes that reducing crime by 50% is possible without considering the number of instances of crime in the area.\n3. \"We'll increase the number of schools by 100%\" - This statement is an example of the base rate fallacy because it assumes that increasing the number of schools by 100% will result in a better education system without considering the number of students in each", "A detailed plan for an election campaign using the first example of the base rate fallacy would involve the following steps:\n\n1.

Rigor: The argument should be supported by credible evidence and logical reasoning, and should not rely on fallacious or unsubstantiated claims.\n5.

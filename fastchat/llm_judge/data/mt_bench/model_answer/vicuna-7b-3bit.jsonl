This is because the force of gravity between the Earth and the satellite is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. As the distance between the Earth and the satellite increases, the force of gravity decreases, causing the satellite's speed to decrease.\n\nTo understand why the orbital radius increases and the period of revolution decreases, consider the following:\n\n1. Increased orbital radius: The increased distance between the Earth and the satellite means that the force of gravity between them is weaker. This results in a smaller force acting on the satellite, causing its speed to decrease. However, since the distance between the Earth and the satellite has increased, the total force of gravity remains constant, so the satellite's orbital radius increases.\n2. Decreased period of revolution: As the satellite's speed decreases, its period of revolution also decreases. This is because the time it takes for the satellite to complete one orbit around the Earth depends on its speed. Since the speed has decreased, the time it takes for the satellite to complete one orbit also", "There are a few corner cases or edge cases that need to be considered when dealing with the relationship between a satellite's speed, orbital radius, and period of revolution. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Residual forces: When a satellite is in a circular orbit, there are always residual forces acting on it, such as atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure. These forces can cause the satellite to lose altitude and change its orbit. To handle this, we need to take into account the effects of these forces when modeling the satellite's behavior.\n2. Non-uniform rotation of the Earth: The Earth's rotation is not uniform, and this can cause issues when modeling the Earth's gravitational force on a satellite. To account for this, we need to use a more accurate model of the Earth's shape and rotation, which can be obtained from geodetic models.\n3.
